FreeClimb will use the `callConnectUrl` and `statusCallbackUrl` set on the application. The application must have a `callConnectUrl` associated with it or an error will be returned. The application’s `voiceUrl` parameter is not used for outbound calls. |   | . send_digits | str | String of digits to dial after connecting to the number. It can include digits `0-9`, ``, and `#`, and allows embedding a pause between the output of individual digits. The default pause is 500 milliseconds. So, a string such as *1234# will be played in 2 seconds because of the 4 standard pauses implied within the string.

    "title": "PerCL",
    "content": "PerCL . The Performance Command Language (PerCL) defines a set of instructions, written in JSON format, that express telephony actions to be performed in response to an event on the FreeClimb platform. FreeClimb communicates with the application server when events associated with the application occur, so the webserver can instruct FreeClimb how to handle such events using PerCL scripts. For further details on PerCL, visit the PerCL Documentation. . PerCL example generation . import freeclimb say = freeclimb.Say(text=&quot;Hello! This is a message sent using FreeClimb&#39;s Python SDK.&quot;) return freeclimb.PerCLCommand.to_json(say.to_dict()) . The JSON object below represents the PerCL object generated by the commands above. . [ { &quot;Say&quot; : { &quot;text&quot; : &quot;Hello! This is a message sent using FreeClimb&#39;s Python SDK.&quot; } } ] . Class Description . AddToConference | Add a Participant to a Conference | . CreateConference | Creates a new conference with no Participants | . Dequeue | Dequeue a Call that is in a Queue so the waiting Caller exits Queue | . Enqueue | Adds a Call to a call Queue | . GetDigits | Collects DTMF inputs from the Caller | . GetSpeech | Allows the Caller to respond to the application using a supported language | . Hangup | Terminates a Call | . OutDial | Begin a Call to a phone number | . Pause | Delays execution of PerCL script to create a Pause in the scenario | . PlayEarlyMedia | Plays an audio file before attempting to connect the Call | . Play | Plays an audio file back to the Caller | . RecordUtterance | Records the Caller’s voice and returns the URL of a file containing the audio recording | . Redirect | Transfers Call to a different URL | . Reject | The Reject command blocks an incoming Call. | . RemoveFromConference | Removes a Participant from a Conference | . Say | Provides Text-To-Speech (TTS) support | . SendDigits | Plays DTMF tones on a live Call | . SetListen | Enables or disables the listening ability for a Conference Participant | . SetTalk | Enables or disables the talking ability for a Conferencwe Participant | . SMS | Sends an SMS message | . StartRecordCall | Records the current Call and returns the URL of a file containing the audio recording | . TerminateConference | Terminates an existing Conference | . AddToConference . The AddToConference command adds a Participant to a Conference. If this Participant currently is in another Conference, the Participant is first removed from that Conference. Two Call legs can be bridged together by creating a Conference and adding both Call legs to it via AddToConference. . Example: . import freeclimb addToConference = freeclimb.AddToConference(conference_id=&#39;CF_your_conference_id&#39;, call_id=&#39;CA_your_call_id&#39;) return freeclimb.PerCLCommand.to_json(addToConference.to_dict()) . Attributes: . Name Type Description Required . conference_id | string | ID of the Conference to which to add the Participant (Call leg). Conference must exist or an error will result. | Required | . call_id | string | ID of the Call that will be added to the specified Conference. The Call must be in progress or an error will result. | Required | . start_conf_on_enter | boolean | Flag that indicates whether a Conference starts upon entry of this particular Participant. | Optional | . talk | boolean | If true, the Participant joins the Conference with talk privileges. | Optional | . listen | boolean | If true, the Participant joins the Conference with listen privileges. This may be modified later via the REST API or SetListen PerCL command. | Optional | . allow_call_control | boolean | If true, Call control will be enabled for this Participant’s Call leg. | Optional | . call_control_sequence | string | Defines a sequence of digits that, when entered by this caller, invokes the call_control_url. Only digits plus ‘*’, and ‘#’ may be used. | Required only when allow_call_control is set to true | . call_control_url | absolute URL | URL to be invoked when this Participant enters the digit sequence defined in the callControlSequence attribute. | Required only when allow_call_control is set to true | . leave_conference_url | absolute URL | URL to be invoked when the Participant leaves the Conference via any of the following methods: RemoveFromConference,TerminateConference, Conference Participant API DELETE request, Conference API POST request with status=empty, Conference API POST request with status=terminated, Participant hangs up | optional | . notification_url | absolute URL | When the Participant enters the Conference, this URL will be invoked using an HTTP POST request with the standard request parameters. | optional | . CreateConference . The CreateConference command does exactly what its name implies — it creates an unpopulated Conference (one without any Participants). Once created, a Conference remains in FreeClimb until explicitly terminated by a customer. Once a Conference has been terminated, it can no longer be used. . CreateConference is a terminal command (any actions following it are never executed). When the Conference is successfully created, FreeClimb invokes the provided actionUrl using an HTTP POST with a createConference Webhook as the body. After this request, control picks up using the PerCL code received in the response. . Example: . import freeclimb conference = freeclimb.CreateConference(action_url=&#39;http://example.com/action&#39;, status_callback_url=&#39;http://example.com/status&#39;) return freeclimb.PerCLCommand.to_json(conference.to_dict()) . Attributes: . Name Type Description Required . action_url | absolute URL | This URL is invoked once the Conference is successfully created. | Required | . alias | string | Descriptive name for the Conference. | Optional | . play_beep | always, never, entryOnly, or exitOnly | Indicates whether to play a beep when a Participant enters or leaves the Conference. | Optional | . record | boolean | When set to true, the entire Conference is recorded. The statusCallbackUrl of the Conference will receive a conferenceRecordingEnded Webhook when the Conference transitions from the inProgress to empty state. | Optional | . wait_url | absolute URL | If specified, this URL provides the custom hold music for the Conference when it is in the populated state. | Optional | . status_callback_url | This URL is invoked when the status of the Conference changes or when a recording of the Conference has become available. | Optional |   | . Dequeue . The Dequeue command transfers control of a Call that is in a Queue so that the waiting caller exits the Queue. Execution continues with the first command in the PerCL script returned by the actionUrl specified in the Enqueue command. . Example: . import freeclimb dequeue = freeclimb.Dequeue() return freeclimb.PerCLCommand.to_json(dequeue.to_dict()) . Attributes: . Dequeue does not support any attributes . Enqueue . The Enqueue command adds the current Call to a call Queue. If the specified Queue does not exist, it is created and then the Call is added to it. The default maximum length of the queue is 100. This can be modified using the REST API. . Example: . import freeclimb enqueue = freeclimb.Enqueue(queue_id=&#39;QU_your_queue_id&#39;, wait_url=&#39;http://example.com/wait&#39;, action_url=&#39;http://example.com/action&#39;) return freeclimb.PerCLCommand.to_json(enqueue.to_dict()) . Attributes: . Name Type Description Required . queue_id | string | ID of the Queue to which to add the Call. If the Queue does not exist, it will be created. | Optional | . action_url | absolute URL | A request is made to this URL when the Call leaves the Queue, which can occur if enqueue of the Call fails or when the call is dequeued via the Dequeue command, the REST API (POST to Queue Member resource), or the caller hangs up | Required | . wait_url | absolute URL | Specifies a URL pointing to a PerCL script containing actions to be executed while the caller is waiting in the Queue. | Required | . notification_url | absolute URL | URL to be invoked when the call enters the queue. | Optional | . GetDigits . Example: . import freeclimb get_digits = freeclimb.GetDigits(action_url=&#39;http://example.com&#39;, max_digits=1, min_digits=1, flush_buffer=True) return freeclimb.PerCLCommand.to_json(get_digits.to_dict()) . Attributes: . Name Type Description Required . action_url | absolute URL |   | Required | . initial_timeout_ms | integer &gt; 0 | Maximum time in milliseconds that FreeClimb will wait for the Caller to press the first digit | Optional | . digit_timeout_ms | integer &gt; 0 | Maximum time in milliseconds that FreeClimb will wait for the Caller to press any digit after the last digit entered | Optional | . finish_on_key | any digit, #, * | Digit that causes the input sequence to be deemed complete. | Optional | . min_digits | integer &gt;= 0 | Minimum number of digits expected in the input. | Optional | . max_digits | integer &gt;= 0 | Maximum number of digits expected in the input. | Optional | . flush_buffer | boolean | If true, the FreeClimb platform starts with an empty DTMF buffer to store the digits entered by the caller. If false, FreeClimb will append the user inputs to the end of the existing digits buffer and will return digits from the start of the digits buffer. | Optional | . prompts | PerCL command array | JSON array of PerCL commands to nest within the GetDigits command. | Optional | . enforcePCI | boolean | Parameter enforcePCI obscures the result as required by PCI compliance. | Optional | . GetSpeech . The GetSpeech command enables the Caller to respond to the application using a supported language. Unlike DTMF entry, which implicitly restricts the user to using the available buttons on the phone key pad, speech input allows for flexible audio inputs based on grammar. FreeClimb supports grammars written using GRXML compatible with the Microsoft Speech Platform. . Example: . import freeclimb get_speech = freeclimb.GetSpeech(action_url=&#39;http://example.com/action&#39;, grammar_type=&#39;BUILTIN&#39;, grammar_file=&#39;VERSAY_YESNO&#39;) return freeclimb.PerCLCommand.to_json(get_speech.to_dict()) . Attributes: . Name Type Description Required . action_url | absolute URL | When the caller has finished speaking or the command has timed out, FreeClimb will make a POST request to this URL. | Required | . grammar_type | URL or BUILTIN | The grammar file type to use for speech recognition. | optional | . grammar_file | absolute URL or built-in grammar file | The grammar file to use for speech recognition. | Required | . grammar_rule | string | The grammar rule within the specified grammar file to use for speech recognition. | Optional | . play_beep | boolean | Indicates whether a beep should be played just before speech recognition is initiated so that the speaker can start to speak. | Optional | . prompts | PerCL command array | The JSON array of PerCL commands to nest within the GetSpeech command. | Optional | . no_input_timeout_ms | integer &gt; 0 | When recognition is started and there is no speech detected for noInputTimeoutMs milliseconds, the recognizer will terminate the recognition operation. | Optional | . recognition_timeout_ms | integer &gt; 0 | When playback of prompts ends and there is no match for recognitionTimeoutMs milliseconds, the recognizer will terminate the recognition operation. | Optional | . confidence_threshold | float range 0.0-1.0 | When a recognition resource recognizes a spoken phrase, it associates a confidence level with that match. Parameter confidenceThreshold specifies what confidence level is considered a successful match. | Optional | . sensitivity_level | float range 0.0-1.0 | The speech recognizer supports a variable level of sound sensitivity. | Optional | . speech_complete_timeout_ms | integer &gt; 0 | Specifies the length of silence required following user speech before the speech recognizer finalizes a result. | optional | . speech_incomplete_timeout_ms | integer &gt; 0 | Specifies the length of silence following user speech after which a recognizer finalizes a result. | optional | . enforcePCI | boolean | Parameter enforcePCI will not log the ‘text’ as required by PCI compliance. | optional | . Hangup . The Hangup command terminates a Call. If Hangup is used as the first action in a PerCL response, it does not prevent FreeClimb from answering the Call and billing your account. See the Reject command to hang up at no charge. . Example: . import freeclimb hangup = freeclimb.Hangup() return freeclimb.PerCLCommand.to_json(hangup.to_dict()) . Attributes: . Name Type Description Required . call_id | string | The ID of the Call leg to hang up. If not specified, the Call leg corresponding to the current PerCL execution context hangs up. | Optional | . reason | string | The user defined reason for the hangup.

The Performance Command Language (PerCL) defines a set of instructions, written in JSON format, that express telephony actions to be performed in response to an event on the FreeClimb platform. FreeClimb communicates with the application server when events associated with the application occur, so the webserver can instruct FreeClimb how to handle such events using PerCL scripts. . PerCL example: . say = freeclimb.Say(text=&quot;Hello! This is a message sent using FreeClimb&#39;s Python SDK.&quot;) return freeclimb.PerCLCommand.to_json(say.to_dict()) . The JSON object below represents the PerCL object generated by the commands above. . [ { &quot;Say&quot; : { &quot;text&quot; : &quot;Hello! This is a message sent using FreeClimb&#39;s Python SDK.&quot; } } ] . Class Description . AddToConference | Add a Participant to a Conference | .
